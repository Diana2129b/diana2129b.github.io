Hello,

For my Twine story, I want to depict a small narrative of Anne Boleyn using representative examples, causes/effects, and added images for visual effects. Many people overlook her name due to King Henry VIII's multiple marriages, but her life holds major historical significance for English history. Her refusal to become a mistress led to King Henry's persistence and eventually caused the English Reformation. Without her determination and attitude, the outcome of world history would have been completely different. I have included variables, conditionals, and user input effects to engage the user throughout the story. Although the outcome of her life wasn't what one would expect, she left a Tudor legacy through the birth of her daughter, Queen Elizabeth I. My main goal is to pique the interests of players to learn more about her life story. I hope you enjoy!
