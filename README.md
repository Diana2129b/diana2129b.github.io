Hello,

For my Twine story I wanted to depict a small narrative of Anne Boleyn by using representative examples as well as causes/effects with some added images to add visual effects for users. Many people will overlook her name due to the multiple marriages King Henry III went through over the course of his reign. However, her life story holds major historical significance for English history. Her resistance to refuse becoming a mistress led to constant persistence of King Henry III that eventually caused the English Reformation.  If it wasn’t for her determination & attitude, the outcome of World history would have a completely different narrative. I have included variables, conditionals & user input effects throughout the story to engage the user throughout the story.  Although, the outcome of her life wasn’t one that would be expected, she left a Tudor legacy through the birth of her daughter Queen Elizabeth I. My main goal is to pique the interests of players to learn more about her life story. I hope you enjoy!
